# Vitals-Monitoring-with-AI
AI-powered vitals monitoring system integrating sensors (ECG, oximeter, BP, glucose) with real-time data processing, anomaly detection, and predictive health insights. Includes hardware drivers, backend APIs, AI models, and doctor/patient dashboards.

This project combines IoT hardware, cloud backend, AI diagnostics, and user-friendly mobile/web apps to create a scalable system for remote healthcare and preventive medicine.

🚀 Key Features

Sensor Integration – Supports oximeter, ECG, blood pressure, and blood sugar sensors via Arduino/Raspberry Pi.

Real-Time Monitoring – Streams and stores live vitals data securely.

AI Diagnostics – ML models for ECG arrhythmia detection, BP trend analysis, SpO₂ anomaly alerts, and glucose predictions.

Doctor & Patient Dashboards – Mobile and web apps for personalized health visualization and doctor-patient interaction.

Alerts & Recommendations – Intelligent notifications for abnormal readings, with lifestyle/optimization suggestions.

Scalable Deployment – Dockerized microservices with optional Kubernetes for production.
